In the new normal, Filipinos begin to rely on the internet. With the existing
lockdown and/or minimization of travel, social interactions become limited.
As we adjust to today's challenges brought by the pandemic, we start to depend
on voice calls and video calls done in our smart devices to be able to study, 
work, and play from each of our homes. Stress has also undeniably become a
part of our lives on an almost daily basis. 
In response to this, team Cracc 'n' Hacc offers a possible approach for
Filipinos to overcome the new normal.

The solution our team has come up with is to develop a multiplayer game 
which is meant to be a leisure activity for Filipinos. 
It stimulates hand-eye coordination, problem-solving skills,
and the mind's ability to process information. Subsequently, this game
also challenges the users to engage in social interactions and conversations
with other users which enhances teamwork skills and word skills. On top of that,
this game also aims to entertain, and alleviate stress.

==========================================================================

The game is entitled "Mischief Manor"

Mischief Manor is a multiplayer game meant to test the trust and teamwork
of 5 players. They may use their words in working together to solve the
presented puzzles while avoiding the deviant's deceptive methods.
